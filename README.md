## :exclamation: This Software is currently a work in progress, some parts may not work as intended. It's in active development.

A PyQt6 GUI for [Blocks](https://blockstec.com) 3D Printers, based on [KlipperScreen GUI](https://github.com/KlipperScreen/KlipperScreen). But can work with other printers. 

Following the same philosophy as KlipperScreen, Blocks_Screen interfaces with [Klipper Firmware](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper) via [Moonraker API](https://github.com/arksine/moonraker). Ence the naming for this software comes as a tribute to the KlipperScreen project.
